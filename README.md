<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

DISCAIMER: This project is the early stages and the commands can change at any point.

When I looked around, there weren't many Discord bots for the stock market, and the bots I did find weren't in a format that I liked or were missing features I wanted. Since they were lacking things I wanted, I decided to make my own with a nicer format and different features.


### Built With

* [Go](https://golang.org/)
* [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)
* [fmpcloud-go](github.com/spacecodewor/fmpcloud-go)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

A couple of things youll need before you can have Narwhal up and running:
* Go 1.x
* [A Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* [A Financial Modeling Prep API key](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer)

### Installation

1. Get your API keys
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Alackey/Stonks.git
   ```
3. Download the go modules
   ```sh
   go mod download
   ```
4. Set environment variables manually, or copy the .env.example and create a .env file with the environment variables
5. Start the bot
   ```sh
   go run .
   ```


### AWS Elastic Beanstalk
I am currently hosting this bot on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and to deploy this app to a currently existing Elastic Beakstalk environment you would run the command below. 

```sh
eb deploy {ENVIRONMENT_NAME}
```

This command uses the Buildfile and Procfile for building and deploying the bot to Elastic Beanstalk.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
All commands begin with the default "$" prefix. For example: 

 ```sh
  $somecommand arg1 arg2 ...arg
  ```
